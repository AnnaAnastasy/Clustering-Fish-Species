# Fish Clustering Using Diverse Techniques

This project demonstrates various clustering techniques applied to a dataset related to fish. The primary goal is to explore, visualize, and cluster data effectively using different methods, providing insights into patterns and groupings within the dataset.

---

## Introduction

Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to group data points based on similarity. This notebook showcases various clustering approaches applied to a fish dataset, including:

- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- DBSCAN
- Spectral Clustering

These techniques are evaluated and visualized to compare their effectiveness.

## Technologies Used

The notebook leverages the following tools and libraries:

- Python (3.x)
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Notebook Structure

The notebook is organized into the following sections:

1. **Introduction and Objective**: An overview of the clustering problem and dataset.
2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Reading and cleaning the fish dataset.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical summaries to understand the data.
4. **Clustering Techniques**:
   - Implementation of K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN, and Spectral clustering.
   - Visualization of clusters.
5. **Comparison and Evaluation**: Metrics and observations comparing the methods.
6. **Conclusion**: Summary of findings and insights.
